							<h2>About ArtGallery_AI</h2>
                            <p>We bring art imagined by a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to Cardano. Made with love and passion, on Earth! This is our first step into the NFT world, and which Blockchain could be better than Cardano?</p>
                            <h2>What are GANs?</h2>
                            <p>GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. Two neural networks contest with each other in a game (in the form of a zero-sum game, where one agent's gain is another agent's loss). Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. For example, a GAN trained on abstract art can generate new paintings of abstract art that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics. </p>
